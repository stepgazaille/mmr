Rolling stock leasing company Akiem and mobility technology leader Bombardier Transportation have signed two contracts under frame contracts to deliver a total of 33 BOMBARDIER TRAXX locomotives.
Based on their list price, the two firm orders are valued at a combined total of €112 million ($128 million US).
Scheduled for delivery between 2019 and 2021 at the latest, the 33 TRAXX locomotives will consist of a mix of TRAXX MS 2 (multi-system), TRAXX AC 3 (alternating current) and TRAXX DC3 (direct current) locomotives.
Fabien Rochefort, CEO of Akiem Group, said, “This additional batch of 33 TRAXX locomotives meets our customers’ demand across Europe.
With a fleet of 180 TRAXX by 2020, we are strengthening our ability to deliver reliable, efficient, safe and cost-effective traction services expected by both passenger and freight operators.
This fruitful partnership with Bombardier Transportation enables Akiem Group industrial teams to design and deliver tailor-made services and maintenance solutions across Europe.
We are making our Group a major long-term, reliable partner and added value provider for the railway transport industry in Europe.”
Peter Ammann, Head of Ecosystem Freight Corridors, Bombardier Transportation, added, “We are very pleased to have received these additional locomotive orders from Akiem, further strengthening our partnership with this important customer.
We introduced our versatile TRAXX locomotives platform 18 years ago and since then have continuously innovated and improved its features.
With over 2,200 units sold, the platform has demonstrated its success.
With these recent orders, Akiem will own a fleet of 180 TRAXX locomotives; the customer continues to benefit from this mixture of performance, experience and permanent evolution.”
The BOMBARDIER TRAXX 3 platform is the most modern four-axle locomotive platform in Europe. Its three models, TRAXX AC3, TRAXX MS3 and TRAXX DC3, all offer optional Last Mile function, a support diesel engine which bridges non-electrified sections.
The TRAXX MS locomotive plays a crucial role in the development of economies in Europe.
Designed to operate on Europe’s four main rail supply voltages – 15 kV and 25 kV AC as well as 1.5 and 3 kV DC – it offers the necessary flexibility and interoperability to manage international rail transport across the continent.
