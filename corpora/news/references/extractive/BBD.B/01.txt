Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) said on Thursday it would sell two businesses for around $900 million (£689 million) and cut 5,000 jobs and as it expands its stronger corporate jet and rail divisions, but the company's shares fell as much as 26 percent on a disappointing free cash flow forecast.
"2018 free cash flow was lower than my expectations," said Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins.
Jamie Koutsoukis, a senior analyst at Moody's, said by email she believes Bombardier has "an uncertain ability to generate positive free cash flow in 2019."
