Musk clearly thinks Tesla cannot run without him. Musk said he was “deeply saddened and disappointed” by this “unjustified action”. The SEC charged Tesla with failing to have required disclosure controls and procedures for Musk’s tweets. The settlement reached on Saturday does not go as far as the regulator initially demanded when it said that Musk should be barred from running Tesla, a sanction that many investors said would be disastrous for the loss-making electric carmaker.
